      <description>K means is one of the simplest algorithms for unsupervised learning. It works iteratively to cluster together similar values in a dataset of one to many dimensions ($X\in\mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$). The algorithmic steps are simple, it relies only on arithmetic means, so it&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple to understand, but can also be quite powerful. Because it relies on random sampling to initiate the algorithm it can be quite slow however, as there is a need to complete many replications to get a robust result.</description>

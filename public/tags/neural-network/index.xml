      <description>One of my New Year resolutions is to get to grips with deep learning. I thought a good place to start would be a refresher into &amp;lsquo;shallow&amp;rsquo; neural networks, and that is what this post and the one that follows it will be about. I&amp;rsquo;ll go through the maths behind a quick dirty neural network, and implement it in R.
I&amp;rsquo;m using as my sources the tome Elements of Statistical Learning, Andrew Ng&amp;rsquo;s excellent machine learning course on coursera, and a short course I have been doing on Udemy: Deep Learning in Python.</description>

      <description>I recently attended the conference Effective Applications of the R language in London. One of the many excellent speakers described how one can use Spark to apply some simple Machine Learning to larger data sets and then extend the range of potential models by simply adding water.
We explore some of the main features and how to get started in this blog. Spark is a general purpose cluster computing system.</description>

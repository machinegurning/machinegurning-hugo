I&amp;rsquo;ve been working through a year&amp;rsquo;s worth of sensor data that I collected using Raspberry Pis. In the last post on this subject I compared my temperature records with records from a local weather station. In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to look at the light measurements. I have two main questions I would like to answer:
 Can the light patterns be used to explain the temperature patterns noted in my temperature post.</description>

      <description>In my last post I started meddling with the ESP8266 module as a low cost (and smaller) alternative to an Arduino or Raspberry Pi for creating home sensors.
I was toying with the idea of sending measurements to a database using a RESTful API on the existing Postgres database I use to host measurements on Amazon Web Services.
After a bit of reading, I&amp;rsquo;ve realised that there is a better solution: MQTT, a lightweight protocol designed for machine to machine (M2M) communication for sensors, and similar low powered and simple devices.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with Arduinos and Raspberry Pis (mostly the latter) for a couple of years now. I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly been interested in producing Wi-Fi enables sensors that can measure things like temperature, and electricity usage throughout the home. I&amp;rsquo;m currently part way through a number of posts in which I have been analysing a year&amp;rsquo;s worth of data collected using some of these sensors, in the last post I dealt with a year&amp;rsquo;s worth of [temperature measurements]().</description>

      <description>In my last post I started to delve into a year of sensor data that I have been collecting with my Raspberry Pi sensors. I made some general observations about the data, and went through the process of cleaning it.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll taking a deeper look at the temperature data. I currently have three temperatrue sensors: two internal (one a DS18B20, and a second within an DHT22 combined temperature and humidity sensor) and one external (another DS18B20).</description>

      <title>Measuring obsession</title>

      <description>I like measuring things. There&amp;rsquo;s something about distilling life&amp;rsquo;s patterns into numbers which is deeply satisfying. I can&amp;rsquo;t explain it. But this is, at least in part, why I became a scientist.
About a year ago, I started exercising this obsession on my everyday life, and built a number of sensors out of Raspberry Pis to monitor the goings on in my house. This has variously fluctuated between one and three Pis, but at present I have two, one monitoring internal and external temperature, and internal light and humidity levels, and one measuring electricity usage by counting the pulses of the LED on my proprietary electricity meter.</description>

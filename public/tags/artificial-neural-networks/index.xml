      <description>One of my New Year resolutions is to get to grips with deep learning. I thought a good place to start would be a refresher into &amp;lsquo;shallow&amp;rsquo; neural networks, and that is what this post and the one that follows it will be about. I&amp;rsquo;ll go through the maths behind a quick dirty neural network, and implement it in R.
I&amp;rsquo;m using as my sources the tome Elements of Statistical Learning, Andrew Ng&amp;rsquo;s excellent machine learning course on coursera, and a short course I have been doing on Udemy: Deep Learning in Python.</description>

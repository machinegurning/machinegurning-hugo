      <description>Markov chains Markov chains, named after Andrey Markov, are mathematical systems that hop from one &amp;ldquo;state&amp;rdquo; (a situation or set of values) to another. See here for an excellent introduction.
The second time I used a Markov chain method resulted in a publication (the first was when I simulated Brownian motion with a coin for GCSE coursework). At the time I was completing it as part of the excellent and highly recommended Sysmic course so that it could contribute to a chapter in my thesis and as a journal article.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m using Hadley&amp;rsquo;s purrr package more and more, and its beginning to change the way I program in R, much like dplyr did.
map() is a great function and one of its incarnations that I really like is map_df().This will apply a function to elements of a list, and then bind the dataframes together (assuming they can be combined). It also allows us to specify additional columns for our final dataframe which takes the names of the elements of the list.</description>

      <description>Last week Matt G tweeted about a quick blog post I wrote about iteratively applying models using some of Hadley&amp;rsquo;s packages, to which Hadley replied:
@mammykins_ @m_a_upson the only thing it&amp;#39;s missing is that you should store related data frames and models as list columns of s data frame
&amp;mdash; Hadley Wickham (@hadleywickham) April 2, 2016 
Now this blog is pretty new, and we haven&amp;rsquo;t made much of an effort to promote it.</description>

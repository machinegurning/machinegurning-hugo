      <description>Markov chains Markov chains, named after Andrey Markov, are mathematical systems that hop from one &amp;ldquo;state&amp;rdquo; (a situation or set of values) to another. See here for an excellent introduction.
The second time I used a Markov chain method resulted in a publication (the first was when I simulated Brownian motion with a coin for GCSE coursework). At the time I was completing it as part of the excellent and highly recommended Sysmic course so that it could contribute to a chapter in my thesis and as a journal article.</description>

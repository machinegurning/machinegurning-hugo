      <description>Sometimes one gets handed so much data you don&amp;rsquo;t know where to begin! You might not even have an associated response variable to complement the hundreds of explanatory variables provided. Instead of attempting to make predictions we can try to make sense of the data using unsupervised learning techniques.
This is challenging in contrast to supervised learning, where there is a simple goal for the analysis, here there is no way to check our work because we don&amp;rsquo;t know the true answer (we have no training set to compare our predictions against).</description>

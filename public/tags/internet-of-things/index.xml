      <description>In my last post I started meddling with the ESP8266 module as a low cost (and smaller) alternative to an Arduino or Raspberry Pi for creating home sensors.
I was toying with the idea of sending measurements to a database using a RESTful API on the existing Postgres database I use to host measurements on Amazon Web Services.
After a bit of reading, I&amp;rsquo;ve realised that there is a better solution: MQTT, a lightweight protocol designed for machine to machine (M2M) communication for sensors, and similar low powered and simple devices.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with Arduinos and Raspberry Pis (mostly the latter) for a couple of years now. I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly been interested in producing Wi-Fi enables sensors that can measure things like temperature, and electricity usage throughout the home. I&amp;rsquo;m currently part way through a number of posts in which I have been analysing a year&amp;rsquo;s worth of data collected using some of these sensors, in the last post I dealt with a year&amp;rsquo;s worth of [temperature measurements]().</description>

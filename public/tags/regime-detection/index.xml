      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for statistical methods and Machine Learning particularly anything with a cool sounding name. When reading about Crouching Tiger Hidden Markov Models in an earlier post I stumbled across a topic called regime detection.
In economics latent Markov models, are so called Regime switching models. Regime Detection comes in handy when you are trying to decide which strategy to deploy. For example there are periods (regimes) when Trend Following strategies, like an autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) or exponential smoothing state space models (ETS) forecasting work better and there are periods when other strategies might be better.</description>

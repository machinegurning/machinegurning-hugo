      <description>I was recently asked to give a talk about Hadley&amp;rsquo;s package testthat. Any discussion of testthat cannot be in isolation - we have to put it into the wider software development context. I think this is the first time that I have used the words software development on this blog, and for many R users, thinking of their code as software development, may not be familiar. In particular, I think that those of us who have come to Data Science or statistical computing from a statistical, especially academic background, tend to have a poor understanding of some common practices among developers that would actually make their lives much easier1.</description>

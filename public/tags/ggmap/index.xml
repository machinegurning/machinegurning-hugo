      <description>In my previous post I started looking at the NY CitiBike data, and the differences between the way men and women use the service. It&amp;rsquo;s clear men use the service more, and that women&amp;rsquo;s journeys are generally longer; however it&amp;rsquo;s not clear if this is because they simply travel slower, or because they aren&amp;rsquo;t always taking the most direct route.
This is a difficult question to answer. Whilst it is easier to know whether the journey time from A to B is longer for men or women, it is not easy to know if the journey was direct.</description>

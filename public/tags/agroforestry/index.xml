      <description>Gypsum blocks In my previous post I was looking into building my own gypsum block soil moisture sensors. All the component parts have now arrived, and so I&amp;rsquo;ve now produced three sensors. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how I made them, show some preliminary data, and talk a bit about how much they cost.
I&amp;rsquo;m using 3 mm A3 stainless steel studding to form the electrodes across which the arduino will measure resistance.</description>

      <description>A bit of context I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing a lot with raspberry pis over the last couple of years. I&amp;rsquo;m now the proud owner of an original Raspberry Pi B, A, two A+s, and a brand spanking new Pi 2. Currently I have one sitting next to my electricity meter reading LED pulses from the meter, charting my electricity consumption, and a second running an external and internal temperature sensor, light, and humidity sensors.</description>

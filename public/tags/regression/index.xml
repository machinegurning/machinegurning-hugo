      <description>Sometimes one gets handed so much data you don&amp;rsquo;t know where to begin! You might not even have an associated response variable to complement the hundreds of explanatory variables provided. Instead of attempting to make predictions we can try to make sense of the data using unsupervised learning techniques.
This is challenging in contrast to supervised learning, where there is a simple goal for the analysis, here there is no way to check our work because we don&amp;rsquo;t know the true answer (we have no training set to compare our predictions against).</description>

      <description>Genetic Programming (GP) is a collection of techniques from evolutionary computing (EC) for the automatic generation of computer programs that perform a user-defined task. Starting with a high-level problem definition, GP creates a population of random programs that are progressively refined through variation and selection until a satisfactory solution is found. A lack of foresight does not prevent this blind watchmaker from arriving at a sensible design solution for modelling the data as demonstrated in this post.</description>

      <description>There seems nothing the British press likes more than a good house price story. Accordingly we use the Kaggle dataset on house prices as a demonstration of the data science workflow. With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home (every dataset has a story, see here for details). I found this dataset particularly interesting, as it informs someone new to he housing market as to what variables one should ask questions about if one were to buy a house.</description>

      <description>I recently attended the conference Effective Applications of the R language in London. One of the many excellent speakers described how one can use Spark to apply some simple Machine Learning to larger data sets and then extend the range of potential models by simply adding water.
We explore some of the main features and how to get started in this blog. Spark is a general purpose cluster computing system.</description>

      <description>Last year I played around a bit with the New York Citibike data, and looked a little bit at the different use patterns among among the sexes, and between subscribers and ad hoc users of the service.
Being an Englishman, I was also wondering if there were differences between the patterns of bike usage on different sides of the Atlantic, so I recently got hold of the 20 million odd records of Barclay Bike data from the Transport for London open data portal.</description>

      <description>In my previous post I started looking at the NY CitiBike data, and the differences between the way men and women use the service. It&amp;rsquo;s clear men use the service more, and that women&amp;rsquo;s journeys are generally longer; however it&amp;rsquo;s not clear if this is because they simply travel slower, or because they aren&amp;rsquo;t always taking the most direct route.
This is a difficult question to answer. Whilst it is easier to know whether the journey time from A to B is longer for men or women, it is not easy to know if the journey was direct.</description>

      <description>One of the first things you notice when drilling down into the New York Citibike data, is that there are a lot more male users than female. It&amp;rsquo;s quite a striking difference between the sexes, and has been picked up in the media. In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to look at the way Citibike usage differs across the sexes.
There are two types of Citibike users: long-term Subscribers to the service, and short term Customers who might only buy a weekly pass.</description>

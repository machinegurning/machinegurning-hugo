Introduction This post is based on a paper by Cortez &amp;amp; Morais (2007). Forest fires are a major environmental issue, creating economical and ecological damage while endangering human lives. Fast detection is a key element for controlling such phenomenon. To achieve this, one alternative is to use automatic tools based on local sensors, such as microclimate and weather data provided by meteorological stations.
All this data holds valuable information, such as trends and patterns, which can be used to improve decision making.</description>
